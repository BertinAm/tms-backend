# WhatsApp Service Disabled

## Overview
The WhatsApp notification service has been temporarily disabled due to issues with the `pywhatkit` library on the Render server deployment.

## What's Disabled

### 1. WhatsApp Service Files
- `abuse_monitor/whatsapp_service.py` - Main WhatsApp service class
- All pywhatkit-related functionality

### 2. Modified Files
- `abuse_monitor/email_monitor.py` - WhatsApp notifications disabled, logging only
- `abuse_monitor/utils.py` - WhatsApp notification function disabled
- `abuse_monitor/views.py` - WhatsApp import and calls disabled
- `abuse_monitor/management/commands/monitor_emails.py` - WhatsApp connection test disabled
- `requirements.txt` - pywhatkit and related dependencies commented out

### 3. Dependencies Removed
- `pywhatkit==5.4`
- `PyAutoGUI==0.9.54`
- `MouseInfo==0.1.3`
- `PyGetWindow==0.0.9`
- `PyMsgBox==1.0.9`
- `pyperclip==1.9.0`
- `PyRect==0.2.0`
- `PyScreeze==1.0.1`
- `pytweening==1.2.0`

## Current Behavior
- Email monitoring continues to work normally
- Tickets are still created and analyzed with AI
- WhatsApp notifications are logged instead of sent
- Notification records are saved with status 'disabled'
- Real-time frontend notifications still work

## Re-enabling WhatsApp
To re-enable WhatsApp notifications when you have a solution (e.g., Twilio API key):

1. Uncomment the dependencies in `requirements.txt`
2. Uncomment the imports in the modified files
3. Restore the WhatsApp service calls
4. Update the notification status from 'disabled' to 'sent'

## Alternative Solutions
Consider these alternatives for WhatsApp notifications:
1. **Twilio WhatsApp Business API** - Paid but reliable
2. **Infobip WhatsApp API** - Professional service
3. **WhatsApp Business API** - Direct integration
4. **Email notifications** - Fallback option

## Status
- ✅ Email monitoring: Working
- ✅ AI analysis: Working  
- ✅ Real-time notifications: Working
- ❌ WhatsApp notifications: Disabled
- ✅ Database operations: Working
